Constitutional AI Training Pipelines

Real evolutionary training for developing genuine AI capabilities.
No templates, no simulation - agents earn their skills through actual learning.

Training Modules:
- language_evolution: Progressive language learning from character to text generation
- pattern_recognition: Visual and sequential pattern learning
- problem_solving: Mathematical and logical reasoning development
- control_tasks: Motor control and optimization problems

All training is guided by constitutional traits, creating diverse learning strategies.
